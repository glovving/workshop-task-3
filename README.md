# workshop-task-3
Creating a randomly generated collage

## Goals and Planning 
### The insturctions given for this workshop task:
- Collect a series of images. Make a p5.js sketch that generates a new collage each time the sketch is run.
- Include manipulations of the images so that they change over time, using filters and/or other kinds of computational interventions.
- Make a new repository for your p5.js project on your GitHub account, publish your sketch as a webpage, and include a README file in your repository with a URL - to the webpage along with documentation of your work.

 ### My plans for this task:
- Choose a selection of images from my camera role
  - One set for the background images, and another set for 'stickers' which will be clear background pngs.
- Have an interactive element:
  - I want to have a default screen with instructions for the user to generate a randomly generated collage.
- Looping
  - I want the user to be able to reset and create a new collage.
