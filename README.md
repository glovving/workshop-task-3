# workshop-task-3
Creating a randomly generated collage

## Goals and Planning 
### The instructions given for this workshop task:
- Collect a series of images. Make a p5.js sketch that generates a new collage each time the sketch is run.
- Include manipulations of the images so that they change over time, using filters and/or other kinds of computational interventions.
- Make a new repository for your p5.js project on your GitHub account, publish your sketch as a webpage, and include a README file in your repository with a URL - to the webpage along with documentation of your work.

 ### My plans for this task:
- Choose a selection of images from my camera role
  - One set for the background images, and another set for 'stickers' which will be clear background pngs.
- Have an interactive element:
  - I want to have a default screen with instructions for the user to generate a randomly generated collage.
- Looping
  - I want the user to be able to reset and create a new collage.

### Notes from the tutorial

The above are the notes I took while watching the workshop 3 tutorial, I just used them as a quick reference while coding so I wouldn't have to google things constantly.

## The Coding Process
I unfortunately did not plan my coding process very thoroughly, did I really document my process very well but I will recount what I did.

I started by going through my camera roll and choosing the images I would use to be part of my collage.
I ending up choosing a set of three images for my backgrounds (these are all photos taken by me).

I chose a set of 5 pngs for my stickers.
